# PatternTests
These are various pattern tests / examples in C#. 

These are all console applications running on the regular version of the .NET Framework (unless otherwise noted). 

Documentation is sparse right now and obviously you will find examples of these patterns elsewhere around the internet in other languages. 

However if you need some .NET examples, this may help.
